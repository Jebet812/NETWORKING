*Networking* is 
## Networking Basics
1. __LAN__: Local Area Network
2. __IP__: Logical address of a device in the network
3. __Router__: Networking device that forwards data packets between "DIFFERENT" computer networks
4. __Switch__: A device within LAN that helps connect devices within the same networj
5. __Subnet__: Set of flags that define your LAN
6. __Gateway__: IP address of the router
7. __WAN__: Wide Area Network
8. __NAT__: Network Address Translation is a method of remmaping an IP address while they are in trasit across the traffic routing device
9. __Firewall__: Set of passive rules to protect network from unathorized access
10. __DMZ__: Demilitarized Zone is a subnetwork that contains and exposes a device to an untrusted network such as the internet
Port Forwarding__: Redirects a communication request from one address and port number combination to another while the packets are travessing a network gateway such a router or firewall

## FUNDAMENTALS OF COMPUTER NETWORK

A *network* is a collection of network enabled devices like switches, routers, printers, computers and servers.

### Network Types
They are categorized into one of the following network categories:
1. __*Personal Area Network (PAN)*__: This provides networking needs around an individual. They typically use Bluetooth to communicate as it provides a low-power, short range data sharing capaility. Network starndards associated with PAN are Bluetooth and IEEE 802.15.
2. __*Local Area Network (LAN)*__: It is the most commonly used classification of a network. It provides networking needs around a single location and is usually privately owned hence needing authentication and authorization to access.
3. __*Metropolitant Area Network (MAN)*__: It provides networking capabilities between two different locations in a city/metropolitant area. Typically, it requires a dedicated and secure connection between each LAN joined to the MAN.
4. __*Wide Area Network (WAN)*__: Provides networking capailities between two different geographical locations locally or worldwide. It links multiple LANs together to create one super network. You can use a virtual private cloud (VPN) to manage connection between different LANs.
